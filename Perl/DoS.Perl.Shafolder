#Kazaa/Morpheus Denial of Service Attack
#Coded by Paul Godfrey
#PaulG@Crackdealer.com
#
#Problem:  Both Kazaa and Morpheus filesharing applications have "backdoors"
#which allow anonymous file access to their shared folder.  What does this have
#to do with Denial of Service?  Unlike connections made from other users
#of the applications, the number of connections to the backdoor cannot be
#regulated or detected by the client.  This obviously will allow us to flood the
#server with requests and therefore use up all of the available bandwidth.
#Also due to the fact that most users have setup their firewall privileges so
#that Kazaa or Morpheus is allowed access to open connections to outside sources
#this attack will bypass most personal firewall clients such as Zone Alarm.
#
#Enjoy.
