Advisory for vqServer 1.4.49

/-|=[explaination]=|-\
When sending vqServer version 1.4.49 a malformed URL request it will crash 
the service. This has been verified to work on the Windows version, but 
it probably is in the linux/unix version and prior versions too.

/-|=[testing it]=|-\
To test this vulnerability, send a GET request with 65000 characters.
So:
GET /AAA (hit return =)
Where AAA = 65000, seeing as Internet Explorer, nor Netscape lets you paste 
that much characters in their browser fields (www.server.com/AAA) you will 
have to use something like Telnet. 
You can easily program something to print 65000 chars in Perl:
open (OUT, ">$ARGV[0]");
print OUT ("GET /");
print OUT ("A" x 65000);
then it's just a cut and paste.
Or you can use the example code below

/-|=[fix]=|-\
the latest edition of vqServer (1.9.47) is unaffected by this. It is available 
for download at www.vqsoft.com

/-|=[notes]=|-\
PUT, POST and the Administration port do not seem to be affected by a high 
amount of characters. The Windows version needed a reinstall every five 
or so crashes. A reboot or total shutdown did not help. 

/-|=[exploit code]=|-\
sinfony quickly wrote some code so you can see if you're vulnerable.
