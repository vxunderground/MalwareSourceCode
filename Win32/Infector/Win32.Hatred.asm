        ===============================================================

        This virus works kinda like this way:

        When  the virus starts, first it locates the following win32 module
 bases:

        Kernel32.dll
        Advapi32.dll
        User32.dll
        Gdi32.dll

        and  their  corresponding  API  function addresses. If this goal is
 achieved without any errors, the virus checks the system out and makes out
 an array containing all drive names that are fixed disks, like this:

        "c:\", "d:\", ..., 0FFh

        This list will be used in infection later.

        After that, the virus checks the registry for this key:

        "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Cursors"

        If it can be opened then the following name is queried:

        "dertaH"

        If  the  value  can be retrieved, it is decrypted with a simple XOR
 algorithm  and  then  it is checked to see if it is really a valid path on
 the hard disk.

        If  the  value cannot be retrieved, or the value retrieved is not a
 valid  path  on  the  HDD,  then the virus initializes the key name with a
 value equal to the first entry in the drives list ("C:\", for ex.).

        After this is done, the scanning procedure is started. The scanning
 procedure  starts  scanning from the root of the matching drive (the drive
 that  was retrieved from the registry) and goes all the way until it finds
 out  the  directory  specified  in the registry (if the virus runs for the
 first  time,  the  first  directory  will  be  the root itself). From that
 directory  on, the virus scans the harddisk for PE files, trying to locate
 5  PE  files.  If  the  5  PE  files  are  not  found on one HDD or on one
 partition,  the  scanning  goes on with the next partition or hdd, as they
 are  found  in  the  drives  list. If the search reaches the end of drives
 list,  but  still  5 PE files were not found, this means that all harddisk
 drives  and all partition tables were checked once and all PE files on the
 entire  system  are  infected. So, the virus resets it's first path to the
 first  root,  and  the  scanning  process  starts  from  the beginning. To
 prevent  a  big system slowdown only 90 directories are checked at a time.
 In  this way, as I tested the scanning procedures many times, basically no
 slowdown  is  notticed.  Still,  all drives and partitions are scanned and
 infected.

        Once  5 files were found, or more than 90 directories were checked,
 the  virus  goes back into the registry and marks there the last directory
 that  was checked. This will be used the next time the virus starts as the
 starting point for the scanning.

        In  the  beginning,  if the key inside the registry is not found, a
 direct  attack  procedure  is  started  which  searches  and  infects  the
 following files:

        CDPLAYER.EXE
        CALC.EXE
        PBRUSH.EXE
        MPLAYER.EXE
        NOTEPAD.EXE
        WINHLP32.EXE

        The  appending  method  is  the  last  section  increase. The virus
 attaches  itself to last section's RVA plus it's virtual size and sets the
 file entrypoint to itself. After finishing all the work, the virus returns
 the control to the host restoring all registers, stack and SEH handlers.

        Each  time  one  directory  is  checked for PE files, all antivirus
 checksum  files  found  in  that directory get erased. The virus avoids to
 infect files with certain names (AV file names)

        The PE files are marked as infected like this:

        Win32VersionValue is set to 'H8'

        This  virus  includes  a slighty modified version of the MOF32 poly
 engine and from my calculation only 4 bytes stay unencrypted in the victim
 file,  which  is  pretty  cool...

        For  the  Anti-debugging  I  have  used some apis that notifies the
 presence  of a debugger and the file is automatically closed. I tried this
 using  the  debugger  in  Visual  C++ and it works. Should crash many code
 emulators which rely on the use of win32 debugging methods.

        This is far the best virus I wrote so far, probably due to the poly
 engine  and the way it is spreading, and it has the highest possibility of
 spreading,  being  very  infectious. I guess probably this will be my last
 win32  directory  scanning virus and my next code will be a resident win32
 virus.

                                        Farewell,
