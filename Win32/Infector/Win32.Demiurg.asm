NAME: Win32.Demiurg
AUTHOR: Black Jack [independant Austrian Win32asm virus coder]
CONTACT: Black_Jack_VX@hotmail.com | http://www.coderz.net/blackjack
TYPE: Win32 global resident (in kernel32.dll) PE/NE/MZ/COM/BAT/XLS infector
SIZE: 16354 bytes

DESCRIPTION:
The main instance of the virus is in infected PE EXE files (or the PE
dropper). If such a file is executed, the first thing the virus does is
getting the needed API addresses by standart methods (first it scans the
hosts import table for the GetModuleHandleA API and uses it to get the
KERNEL32 handle if found, if not, it gets it by the "scan down from the
value from the top of stack"-trick, then the export table of KERNEL32 is
scanned for all needed APIs, finally also ADVAPI32.dll is loaded and some
APIs for registry operations fetched from there). Then the virus performs
two tasks before returning to the host: first infected KERNEL32.dll, then
infected MS-Excel.

To infect KERNEL32.dll, it is copied from the system directory to the windows
directory and infected there. The infection process is the same as with
regular PE EXE files (see later), but not the main entry point is modified,
but some file modification APIs are hooked (to maintain compatiblity to WinNT
in both their ANSI and unicode versions). To replace the old KERNEL32.dll
with the infected copy, the virus uses the MoveFileExA API with the
MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag; this will only work in WinNT, but this
doesn't matter, because Win9x will use the copy in the windows directory
rather than the one in the system directory after the next reboot anyways.

To infect Excel, the virus checks the registry if a supported version (97 or
2000) is installed; if so, it turns the macro virus protection off and gets
the path where it is installed. Then it drops a .xls file with a little macro
as \xlstart\demiurg.xls; this file will be loaded automatically at the next
start of excel, and the macro executed. Besides that, another macro source
code is generated as C:\demiurg.sys file, that contains VBA instructions to
write the virus PE dropper to C:\demiurg.exe and execute it. Please note that
this macro uses 100% VBA instructions (the binary data is stored in Arrays),
no stupid debug scripts. This file will be used to infect regular .xls files
with. This means that the VBA instance of the virus is not a "full" macro
virus, because it is not able to replicate from one .xls file to another
directly.

After the KERNEL32.dll infection, the virus will stay resident after the next
reboot. It then catches most file API functions and infects COM, EXE (MZ, NE,
PE) and BAT files as they are accessed.

The PE EXE infection process is quite standart: The last section is increased,
and the virus body is appended after the virtual end of the section. In my
opinion this is much more logical than appending after the physical end, how
it is done in most Win32 virii nowadays, because otherwise the virus body can
be overwritten by host data (if the last section is the .bss section, for
example). Besides that the virtual size is not aligned (although some
compilers/assemblers like TASM align it to SectionAlign, this is not
necessary), while the physical size is always aligned to FileAlign; this
means we can save some space in some cases. Then the entry point is set to
the virus body (in case of PE EXE files) and finally also the imagesize and
the checksum (in case it was different to zero before infection) are updated
to maintain compatiblity to WinNT; to recalculate the CRC the
CheckSumMappedFile API from IMAGEHLP.dll is used.

All other infectable files are only infected "indirectly": A small piece of
code is added that drops a PE dropper and infects it. Because of that the
virus can only replicate in Win32 enviroments, although it infects a lot of
different filetypes.

DOS EXE files are also infected in standart manner: some code is appended at
the end of file, then the entrypoint and the stack are set to it, and the
internal filesize is recalculated. Sligtly interesting is that the virus is
able to infect files with internal overlays that were generated with borland
compilers, in this case the virus is appended between the internal end of the
file and the overlay, after the overlay has been shifted back. This works
very fine (to my own surprise); try to infect TD.EXE for example.

COM files are infected by internally converting them to EXE files by
prepending a small EXE header, and then infected just like a DOS EXE file.
Of course the virus is also able to deal with ENUNS files, in this case the
ENUNS signature is threated just like an internal overlay.

BAT files are infected by adding some BAT code at the end of the file, then
the the character 1Ah (end of text file; BAT files will be only executed
until this character is reached), and after that the PE dropper. The BAT code
works by ECHOing out a small COM file (which was been written in such a
careful way that it only contains characters that are legit in BAT files) to
C:\DEMIURG.EXE. Then this file is executed with the name of the BAT file as
parameter. Then the COM file reads the PE dropper from the end of the BAT
file and writes it to C:\DEMIURG.EXE too, and then executes the new file.

NE files are infected with the method that was introduced by Mark Ludwig (I
think): The code segment that contains the entry point is increased, the rest
of the file is shifted back and the NE header tables are fixed to reflect the
new layout of the file. Then a small piece of code is injected into the newly
gained room and the entrypoint set to it; besides that the PE dropper is
appended at the end of the file as internal overlay.

                tlink32 /Tpe /aa demiurg.obj,,, import32.lib

                there's no need for PEWRSEC or a similar tool, because the
                virus code is stored in the data section.
