; VirusName: Raping Betrayals
; Country  : Sweden
; Author   : The Unforgiven / Immortal Riot
; Date     : 15/09/1993
;
;
; This is an mutation of Misery from Immortal Riot.
; I mutated this one, cuz Mcafee scan grabbed it
; within one month after we released it. So, now
; "Misery" is called "Raping Betrayls". Many
; thanks to PCM2 for the original Leprosy virus.
;
; Okey..In this version I just changed the new
; Mcafee "Scan-String", by remarking some calls.
; I also added a day checker, and if the
; virus (or a infected file) is run at the 10:th
; any month, procedure "ellie" will go off..  
; Ellie is some sort of heart breaker!..<..hehe..>      
;
; It copies itself into other exe/com files on the current
; drive. The file-size will not be changed, cuz it just
; replaces the code in the beginning with itselves. The
; infected files will not work, instead the virus will 
; run again. The virus uses dot-dot metod for changing dirs. 
;
; There has been many mutations born from Leprosy,
; and here we give you yet another contribution...
; 
; McaFee Scan v108 can't find it, neither can S&S Toolkit 6.54
; Havn't tried with TBScan/F-prot, but they will probably
; identify it as "Leprosy".
