  Lame Unix Viruses
  +---------------+

  Well, you might have read the title to this article and thought, well
  if the damn thing is lame.. why the fuck is it in vlad#4 ?!  This can
  be answered quite simply, we had one free space! :)  It was a bit of
  a dilemma to begin with, we had four articles and one space.  The problem
  was they were all kinda lame.  So it was a lame pick of the month episode.

  Out of the four articles this was the leastest lamest.  Well actually
  I don't know about that, but anyway it was the most different one we
  had sitting there.  Just to prove the title, the author of these
  masterpieces asked to remain anonymous to save his reputation.

  These "viruses" are the equivalent of a DOS batch file infector because
  they are written in shell language.  They function similarly to companion
  infectors by renaming the original file and replacing it with themselves.
  Disinfection is simple by 'mv'ing (moving) the original files back.

  Anyway, perhaps someone is interested so here they are.  There isn't
  much use for them except to annoy your friends when it messes up all
  the files in their directory.
