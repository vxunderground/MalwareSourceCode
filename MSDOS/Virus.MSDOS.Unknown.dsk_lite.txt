What is it?

Pro-Disk-lite is a on-screen disk lite, it will show a floppie-disk in the
upper right courner of your screen if interrupt HEX 13 is called, what means
it will on any kind of disk access.

Why use it?

Because is't handy if you havn't got a (working) LED in your drive, or just
because it looks great!

Who are you?

I'm Dan Joung, a hareware programmammer from the states.
And my friend DarkRay (who allways uses an alias) who drawed the ANSI-screen
for me, excellent work darky!

Costs?

Non, but if you like it you can send me 10 dollar...
