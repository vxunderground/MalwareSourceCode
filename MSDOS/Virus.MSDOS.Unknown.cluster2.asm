; Clust2 virus by John Tardy / TridenT
;
; Virus Name:  Clust2
; Aliases:     Cluster-II, Circus Clusters-II
; V Status:    Released
; Discovery:   Not (yet)
; Symptoms:    .EXE altered, possible "sector not found" errors on disk-drives,
;              decrease in aveable memory
; Origin:      The Netherlands
; Eff Length:  386 bytes (EXE size doesn't change)
; Type Code:   ORhE - Overwriting Resident .EXE Infector
; Detection Method:
; Removal Instructions: Delete infected files or copy infected files with the
;                       virus resident to a device driven unit.
;
; General Comments:
;       The Clust2 virus is not yet submitted to any antiviral authority. It
;       is from the TridenT Virus Research Centre and was written by someone
;       calling himself John Tardy. When an infected program is started, Clust2
;       will become resident in high memory, but below TOM. It hooks interrupt
;       13h and will try to load the program again. Because of it's stealth
;       abilities the original program is loaded and will execute normally.
;       The Clust2 virus infects files when a write request for interrupt 13h
;       is done. It will check if the buffer contains the 'MZ' signature and
;       that the candidate file isn't larger than 65000 bytes, and if there are
;       enough zeros in the EXE-header. If these contidions are met, Clust2
;       will convert the EXE file to a COM file and inserts it's code in the
;       buffer, allowing the original write request to proceed. This way it
;       evades critical errors. The Clust2 virus is also stealth and can't be
;       detected with virus scanners or checksumming software if the virus is
;       resident. File-length and date doesn't change regardless if Clust2
;       is resident. It's also a slighty polymorphic virus, mutating a few
;       bytes in it's decryptor. A wildcarded string is needed to find it.
;       The following text is encrypted within the
;       virus:
;
;        "[Clust2]"
;        "JT / TridenT"
;
;       The Clust2 virus not infect files on device driven units, like drives
;       compressed with DoubleSpace. It will disinfect when copied to such a
;       device.
;
;       Sometimes it will issue a "sector not found" error when a file is
;       copied to a disk drive.
;
;       The Clust2 virus doesn't do anything besides replicating.
