;
; Now in front of you lies another source of a virus. It is not a very good
; one, but, as you might say, a virus is a virus. After my wake at the PC, I
; created several viruses, like:
;
; Deicide / Glenn
; Morgoth
; Breeze
; Brother
; Commentator I
; Commentator II
; Spawnie
; Xmas
; 1St_Star / 222
; T-1000
;
; Well, I bet you think this is a whole lot, but some are minor variants, for
; which I don't have the guts to publish the source code. I have to admid,
; Deicide and Morgoth have spread very well. I uploaded them to a BBS and it
; was downloaded several times, and it is not detected by antivirus program yet.
; Deicide is now detectable, but that was my first attempt to make a virus.
;
; This virus is a Non-Resident Direct Action .COM Infector.
; It only infects files in the current directory.
; You can recognize a infected file simply, the 4th byte is a '*' (just like
; the 1St_Star virus). It is inactive from January till May and starts
; replicating from May. After July, every Wednessday after the 21st the
; program will hang the system, showing the address of RTL4 Joop v/d Ende
; Productions.
;
; Disclaimer : This program is like all other virus sources only for
; educational purposes and should not be given to irresponsible hands
; (John McAfee and people like him).
;
; For the criminal reader : Don't just change the text of this virus and
; say you made a virus. Instead use some ideas from this virus and create your
; own virus if you want to be nasty. Additions to this virus that makes it
; spreading faster and makes it harder to detect are welcome, as long as I get
; the new source code.
;
; I want to thank several virus writers for their support with letting McAfee
; and Ass. earn his money with making so many updates of SCAN...
; Here they are : Bit Addict, XSTC, Dark Helmet, Dark Avenger, Nuke!, Cracker
; Jack and many more creators.
;
; Note to XSTC : Thank you for disassembling the Deicide virus, for I have lost
; the source code. Next time write a message, because I might have the source
; code of the virus ready, but not uploaded. It saves you time, so you may
; disassemble another virus (ofcourse only for educational purposes ;-) )
;
; Now have fun with this virus, written in A86 assembler version 3.22
